Comment[Submitted Name]	miRNA profiling array results in serum RNA (healthy volunteers and breast tumor patients)				
Investigation Title	miRNA profiling array results in serum RNA (healthy volunteers and breast tumor patients)
Experiment Description	To identify serum miRNAs as biomarkers for breast cancer, RNA from 7 serum pools (healthy volunteers: n=100, benign patients: n=100，cancer patients: n=94, Lymph nodes positive: n=36, lymph nodes negative: n=58, carcinoma in situ: n=25, infiltrating carcinoma: n=69) were screened by Affymetrix microarray 4.0.

Protocol Description	The study population consisted of 94 breast cancer patients (mean age, 48 years; range, 28-86 years) and 100 patients with benign tumor (mean age, 39.8 years; range, 19-66 years) who didn’t receive any direct or specific treatment after being enrolled in the study. The control population included 100 healthy volunteers. Controls were matched to the patients based on age, gender and ethnicity. All the donors were female adults. The patients were all newly diagnosed and had not received any treatment for cancer prior to blood collection. The breast cancer patients were subdivided into two groups in two ways: one was lymph nodes metastasis (n=36) or non-metastasis (n=58), and the other was carcinoma in situ (n=25) or infiltrating carcinoma (n=69).The molecular subtypes of patients were assessed by pathological report.Venous blood samples(5ml) were collected from each patient and healthy volunteer in procoagulant drying tubes. The whole blood was centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cells and at 5 000 g for 30 min at 4°C to remove cell debris. Serum was aliquoted and stored at -80°C until used. 	Total RNA was isolated from serum by acid-phenol, chloroform and acidic sodium, and the precipitation was carried out by ethanol.	According to the protocol of FlashTag Biotin RNA Labeling Kit for Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA Arrays.	According to the protocol of Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 4.0.	According to the protocol of Affymetrix® GeneChip® Command Console® Software.
