Hello Boris, Tristan hier!

Project Applied High-throughput Analysis

test Boris

=> analyze omics data
=> find 4 publicly available omics datasets that are somehow related. 

For example: you can evaluate whether expression differences observed in cancer may be attributed to either epigenetic or genetic differences: 
side note: the four datasets should be obtained by a t least thgree different omics technologies, including MICROARRAY AND ONE SEQUENCING BASED METHOD. For example: qPCR, 2types of microarrays and RNA-seq is good.

MAKING THE REPORT: 
two parts=> general information (generally understandable for biologist + code and commands, packages and supplementary figures and tables.  
Essentially, part a) shoudl contain what you've done and why, wereas part b) should demonstrate how you did everything and include the supplements. 
=> ref are needed

one method per dataset is sufficient! 

mogelijkse datasets:
Breast cancer RNA-seq	https://www.omicsdi.org/dataset/arrayexpress-repository/E-GEOD-58135
methylation in breast cancer vs normal tissue https://www.omicsdi.org/dataset/arrayexpress-repository/E-GEOD-35263
Expression data from breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues https://www.omicsdi.org/dataset/omics_ena_project/PRJNA429856
