Protocol Description	Feature Extraction (Agilent Technologies) software version 10.7.3.1 was used for image analysis. ID_REF =  VALUE = gProcessedSignal, given by Agilent	After RNA extraction, 100 ng of total RNAs were dephosphorylated and labeled with pCp-Cy3 by Agilent miRNA Complete Labeling and Hyb Kit (Agilent Technologies, USA, microRNA Spike- In Apply).	2X hybridization buffer (Agilent Technologies, USA) was added to the labeled mixture to a final volume of 45ul. The mixture was heated for 5 min at 100°C and immediately cooled to 0°C. Each 45ul sample was hybridized onto an Agilent human miRNA Microarray Release 12.0, 8x15K (Agilent Technologies, USA) at 55°C for 20 hours.	The tissue are collected from patients directly.	For RNA extraction, total RNA was extracted from tissues collected from the patients by Trizol® Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the instruction mannual. RNA purified was quantified at OD260nm by using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technology, USA) and qualitated by using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technology, USA) with RNA 6000 nano labchip kit (Agilent Technologies, USA).	Slides were scanned on an Agilent microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies, model G2505C) at 100% and 5% sensitivity settings.
